# Simple-System-on-Chip-Interface-Using-MicroBlaze-Processor

In this lab, we created a simplified text mode graphics controller, which is connected to the AXI4-Lite memory-mapped bus and supports 80-column text mode through the VGA/HDMI output using SystemVerilog as an Intellectual Property (IP) core. We learned the basic capability of the MicroBlaze processor as the foundation of our project, and how to incorporate IP core into our project to enhance the capability of the project. The initial design of the project was extended to support per-character colors.
